### I definitely like a challenge every now and then!

Like Al Bundy will never forget about this one time he scored three touchdowns in one game, I will never forget about the time when [I won a Microsoft CloudShow contest and donated the price to a child hospital](https://www.facebook.com/MicrosoftCloudShow/photos/pcb.1486882274730662/1486881964730693/). Yes, still proud of that one!

I like to tinker with technology in my spare time, and sometimes I win some contests along the way.
Like the IFTTT XMAS 2020 challenge. [If you like low-code automation, you might enjoy this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=namYiCXgRIk)

Or the Integromat contest of 2021, which I won as well. [Learn how to create a virtual gallery using nothing but Low Code tools now!](https://medium.com/serverless-and-lowocode-pioneers/winning-with-low-code-the-integromat-contest-of-2021-a1a9df445795)

And that's enough of that - 
I had/have the great honor of working for companies ike [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7014115289978011648/), Bosch, Teradata and others. Being eternally grateful for that.
