## Professional Achievements and Development

My career is marked by a commitment to innovation and delivering business value, including:

-   With many years of experience in IT strategy, customer advisory, and architecture <br> across complex organizations, I've seen a thing or two.
-   My track record demonstrates a knack for improving key performance indicators <br> and reducing costsâ€”because who doesn't love a good ROI and less COPEX?
-   I've successfully led and managed teams across Europe, <br> proving that distance is just a number (and sometimes a timezone headache).
-   I possess a deep understanding of cloud architecture with Azure and AWS, <br> including hybrid setups, data wrangling, analytics, security, and sustainabilityâ€”basically, I speak cloud.
-   My experience includes leading design thinking workshops and AI opportunity mapping sessions, <br> turning "what ifs" into "why nots?".
-   I've applied change management in complex digital transformation scenarios, <br> because let's face it, change is the only constant...and sometimes the biggest headache.
-   My communication skills and ability to orchestrate interdisciplinary teams ensure <br> smooth sailing (well, mostly) and successful outcomes.
-   I was recognized as the winner of the Microsoft internal "AI Pitch Perfect" Contest, <br> proving I can make AI sound exciting even to the uninitiated.
-   My career includes strategic technology roles with leading companiesâ€” <br> I've seen both sides of the tech coin, and I'm happy to say it's not counterfeit.
-   I have a proven ability to articulate architectural differences and drive cost savings, <br> making even the most complex tech understandable (and budget-friendly).
-   I am committed to ongoing learning and development, particularly in emerging tech platforms, <br> which you can see on my [Credly profile](https://www.credly.com/users/mohammed-bruckner/badges).

## Highlighted Publications

[![IT is not magic it is architecture](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81SzWfep24L._SY522_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B0CVZ1BWPN)

**[IT's not magic, it's architecture](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B0CVZ1BWPN)** guides organizations through modern IT landscapes, integrating principles, agility, and AI to create sustainable business advantages.

I'm also pretty chuffed about the glowing Amazon review from Tobias Zwingmann, the AI expert behind those LinkedIn courses on profiting with AI, who said:

> "This book is a quick but must-read for anyone who wants to understand the field of IT architecture better, especially in corporate settings. With a masterful blend between theory and practice, the book covers the essential patterns of IT architecture and strategy, giving IT architects clear guidance to drive real value within their organizations. The chapter on "Agility and IT Architecture" is gold as most organizations are not able to bridge both paradigms of being flexible and structured / organized at scale. Loved the Lego examples that the author brought up. In every page, the practical experience and deep expertise of the author shines through, without making it sound too technical or complex. Highly recommend reading this book!!"
