### Hello, friend!

My name is Mohammed Brueckner and my passion for [technology and strategy shines through in my work](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/mbrueckner). 

Discover more about my interests by browsing through my articles on LinkedIn where I delve into both business and tech-related challenges, from [Change Management](https://github.com/MoBRUEC/MoBRUEC/blob/master/changemanagement.md) to the [intricacies of AI and automation](https://github.com/MoBRUEC/AI-how-to-get-started). 

Integration is a topic that particularly fascinates me, whether it's [integrating systems or bringing diverse teams together for successful outcomes](https://github.com/MoBRUEC/MoBRUEC/blob/master/azsummit23.md). You can catch some of my [insights on Medium as well](https://medium.com/@mohammedbrueckner).

One of my favorite subjects to explore is the ever-evolving world of **Platform Economies** - a topic that continues to shape the future of e-commerce and beyond!
Platform economies refer to the business models and ecosystems that are built around digital platforms, where multiple parties interact and exchange goods, services, or data. These platforms have disrupted traditional business models and transformed entire industries by enabling more efficient transactions and fostering greater collaboration among participants.
[Learn more about platforms from these folks from FAZ](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/fazdeconomy/) or the [great Gregor Hophe and his book on the topic](https://leanpub.com/platformstrategy). :)

And now there is an [OpenAI GPT Chat I created that can answer all your questions regarding the Platform Economies, too](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ZcYuscMSi-platform-economist).

**Enterprise Architecture** is a domain of activities and responsibilities that sits with me for what feels like an eternity.
