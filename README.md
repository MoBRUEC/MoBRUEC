### Hello, friend!

I am Mohammed Brueckner. You can find out about me on my [professional LinkedIn work profile](https://linkedin.com/in/mbrueckner).

In short, I am a technology enthusiast who is putting his feet into business topics as well hardcore tech challenges.
I like working with people - that's why I put quite some effort into studying Change Management and a little bit in Coaching.

If you like Chatbots, you should pay my [Facebook Page a visit](https://m.me/mobrueckner).
Since I like putting up bots and trying to have them do more and more tricks, you will see plenty of automated activity on my [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/moebruec), too.

Some tech related articles are available via dev.to and my old Wordpress blog. I mainly write on LinkedIn, however.

One of my favorite topics is [Platform Economies](https://platformeconomies.com).

Get in touch - I am always curious and eager to collaborate!
