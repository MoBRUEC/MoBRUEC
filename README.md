### Hello, friend!

My name is Mohammed Brueckner and my passion for [technology and strategy shines through in my work](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/mbrueckner). 

Discover more about my interests by browsing through my articles on LinkedIn where I delve into both business and tech-related challenges, from [Change Management](https://github.com/MoBRUEC/MoBRUEC/blob/master/changemanagement.md) to the [intricacies of AI and automation](https://github.com/MoBRUEC/AI-how-to-get-started). 

Integration is a topic that particularly fascinates me, whether it's [integrating systems or bringing diverse teams together for successful outcomes](https://github.com/MoBRUEC/MoBRUEC/blob/master/azsummit23.md). You can catch some of my [insights on Medium as well](https://medium.com/@mohammedbrueckner).

One of my favorite subjects to explore is the ever-evolving world of **Platform Economies** - a topic that continues to shape the future of e-commerce and beyond!
Platform economies refer to the business models and ecosystems that are built around digital platforms, where multiple parties interact and exchange goods, services, or data. These platforms have disrupted traditional business models and transformed entire industries by enabling more efficient transactions and fostering greater collaboration among participants.

**Enterprise Architecture** is a domain of activities and responsibilities that sits with me for what feels like an eternity.
In this video - sorry, only in German! - [I talk with friends from OPITZ CONSULTING about the modern day EA role:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n0MBTRpND4)

Like Al Bundy will never forget about this one time he scored three touchdowns in one game, I will never forget about the time when [I won a Microsoft CloudShow contest and donated the price to a child hospital](https://www.facebook.com/MicrosoftCloudShow/photos/pcb.1486882274730662/1486881964730693/). Yes, still proud of that one!

I like to tinker with technology in my spare time, and sometimes I win some contests along the way.
Like the IFTTT XMAS 2020 challenge. [If you like low-code automation, you might enjoy this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=namYiCXgRIk)

Or the Integromat contest of 2021, which I won as well. [Learn how to create a virtual gallery using nothing but Low Code tools now!](https://medium.com/serverless-and-lowocode-pioneers/winning-with-low-code-the-integromat-contest-of-2021-a1a9df445795)

Want to pick up a great No-Code Automation Tool? Why not start with Power Automate?

And that's enough of that - 
I had/have the great honor of working for companies ike [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7014115289978011648/), Bosch, Teradata and others. Being eternally grateful for that.
