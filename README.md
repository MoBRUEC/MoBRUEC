### Hello, friend!

I am Mohammed Brueckner. You can find out what interests me by checking out my **[LinkedIn articles](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/mbrueckner)**.

In short, I am a technology enthusiast who is putting his feet into business topics as well as hardcore tech challenges.
I like working with people - that's why I put quite some effort into studying Change Management and am open for coaching.

If you like Chatbots, you should pay my [Facebook Message bot a visit](https://m.me/mobrueckner).
Since I like putting up bots and trying to have them do more and more tricks, you will see plenty of automated activity on my **[Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/moebruec)**, too.

Some tech or IT strategy related articles are available via [dev.to](https://dev.to/mrbrue) and my old [Wordpress blog](https://ideasopensourced.wordpress.com). Sometimes on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mohammedbrueckner). I mainly write on LinkedIn, however.

One of my favorite topics is [Platform Economies](https://platformeconomies.com).

Enterprise Architecture is a domain of activities and responsibilities that sits with me for what feels like an eternity.
In this video - sorry, only in German! - I talk with peers from OPITZ CONSULTING about the modern day EA role:

Like Al Bundy will never forget about this one time he scored three touchdowns in one game, I will never forget about the time when [I won a Microsoft CloudShow contest and donated the price to a child hospital](https://www.facebook.com/MicrosoftCloudShow/photos/pcb.1486882274730662/1486881964730693/). Yes, still proud of that one!

I like to tinker with technology in my spare time, and sometimes I win some contests along the way.
Like the IFTTT XMAS 2020 challenge. If you like low-code automation, you might enjoy this one.

Well, with that, I bid you a great day:
