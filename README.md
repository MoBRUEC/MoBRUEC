I am happy about the good Amazon review from Tobias Zwingmann, the AI expert behind those LinkedIn courses on making money with AI, who said:

> "This book is a quick but important read for anyone who wants to understand IT architecture better, especially in company settings. With a great mix of theory and practice, the book covers the main patterns of IT architecture and strategy, giving IT architects clear directions to bring real value within their organizations. The chapter on "Agility and IT Architecture" is gold as most organizations cannot link being flexible and structured / organized at a large scale. I liked the Lego examples the author used. On every page, the author's practical experience and deep knowledge show through, without making it sound too technical or difficult. I strongly suggest reading this book!!"
