### Hello, friend!

I am Mohammed Brueckner. You can find out what interests me by checking out my **[LinkedIn articles](https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/mbrueckner)**.

In short, I am a technology enthusiast who is putting his feet into business topics as well as tech challenges in the machine room.
I like working with people - that's why I put quite some effort into studying Change Management and am open for coaching.

Some tech or IT strategy related articles are available via [dev.to](https://dev.to/mrbrue) and my old [Wordpress blog](https://ideasopensourced.wordpress.com). Sometimes on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mohammedbrueckner). I mainly write on LinkedIn, however.

One of my favorite topics is [Platform Economies](https://platformeconomies.com).

Enterprise Architecture is a domain of activities and responsibilities that sits with me for what feels like an eternity.
In this video - sorry, only in German! - [I talk with friends from OPITZ CONSULTING about the modern day EA role:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n0MBTRpND4)
[![EAM Reloaded](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7n0MBTRpND4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n0MBTRpND4)

Like Al Bundy will never forget about this one time he scored three touchdowns in one game, I will never forget about the time when [I won a Microsoft CloudShow contest and donated the price to a child hospital](https://www.facebook.com/MicrosoftCloudShow/photos/pcb.1486882274730662/1486881964730693/). Yes, still proud of that one!

I like to tinker with technology in my spare time, and sometimes I win some contests along the way.
Like the IFTTT XMAS 2020 challenge. [If you like low-code automation, you might enjoy this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=namYiCXgRIk)

[![IFTTT XMAS CONTEST 2020](https://img.youtube.com/vi/namYiCXgRIk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=namYiCXgRIk)

Or the Integromat contest of 2021, which I won as well. [Learn how to create a virtual gallery using nothing but Low Code tools now!](https://medium.com/serverless-and-lowocode-pioneers/winning-with-low-code-the-integromat-contest-of-2021-a1a9df445795)
[![Integromat contest won in 2021!](https://objectstorage.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/n/fr3k19weeykl/b/goodiesgalore/o/integromat-contest-2021.jpg)](https://medium.com/serverless-and-lowocode-pioneers/winning-with-low-code-the-integromat-contest-of-2021-a1a9df445795)

Want to pick up a great No-Code Automation Tool? Why not start with Power Automate? [I have some recipes for you.](https://github.com/MoBRUEC/powerautomaterecipes) -- If you are into serverless cloud architecture, you might [enjoy these write-ups here.](https://medium.com/serverless-and-lowocode-pioneers)

And that's enough of that - 
I had/have the great honor of working for companies ike [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7014115289978011648/), Bosch, Teradata and others. Being eternally grateful for that.

I bid you a great day!
