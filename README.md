### Professional Achievements and Development

My career is marked by a commitment to innovation and delivering business value, including:

*   With many years of experience in IT strategy, customer advisory, and architecture <br> across complex organizations, I've seen a thing or two.
*   My track record demonstrates a knack for improving key performance indicators <br> and reducing costs—because who doesn't love a good ROI and less COPEX?
*   I've successfully led and managed teams across Europe, <br> proving that distance is just a number (and sometimes a timezone headache).
*  I possess a deep understanding of cloud architecture with Azure and AWS, <br> including hybrid setups, data wrangling, analytics, security, and sustainability—basically, I speak cloud.
*   My experience includes leading design thinking workshops and AI opportunity mapping sessions, <br> turning "what ifs" into "why nots?".
*   I've applied change management in complex digital transformation scenarios, <br> because let's face it, change is the only constant...and sometimes the biggest headache.
*   My communication skills and ability to orchestrate interdisciplinary teams ensure <br> smooth sailing (well, mostly) and successful outcomes.
*   I was recognized as the winner of the Microsoft internal "AI Pitch Perfect" Contest, <br> proving I can make AI sound exciting even to the uninitiated.
*   My career includes strategic technology roles with leading companies— <br> I've seen both sides of the tech coin, and I'm happy to say it's not counterfeit.
*   I have a proven ability to articulate architectural differences and drive cost savings, <br> making even the most complex tech understandable (and budget-friendly).
*   I am committed to ongoing learning and development, particularly in emerging tech platforms, <br> which you can see on my [Credly profile](https://www.credly.com/users/mohammed-bruckner/badges).
