# Change Management never really changes... Now wait.

Yes of course, even the academia behind Change Management is evolving. It is true though some underlying principles do not go away. Even **ChatGPT** was eventually kind enough to [admit that the change management efforts required for a "Tech" project is comparable to any other change management project to the greatest extent](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mbrueckner_chatgpt-on-change-management-and-why-do-not-activity-7028610804652371968-3gok).

The amazing fact that more than 70% of all "projects" fail still stands - [**explore my interactive Double Trinity Pyramid model to understand why that is and what we need to take into consideration to change that!**](https://mohammed-brueckner.com/changemanagement/double-trinity-change-model/)

You see, change is a recurring theme here, all along.

One of the most important take-aways for anybody willing to get better at Change Management is that in order to achieve that you need to change **yourself** first.

## The Double Trinity Pyramid: A Mental Model for Change

After years of experience in organizational transformation, I developed a mental model that helps explain why some change initiatives succeed while others fail: the **Double Trinity Pyramid**.

**[🔗 Explore the Interactive Model](https://mohammed-brueckner.com/changemanagement/double-trinity-change-model/)**

This model illustrates how successful organizational change requires balancing two critical trinities:

### Organizational Trinity
The three pillars that must work in harmony for effective organizational change:

- **People:** The human element driving and affected by change - including leadership support, employee engagement, and the right skill sets
- **Processes:** Well-defined workflows and procedures that provide structure, consistency, and efficiency
- **Technology:** The tools and systems that enable change at scale and provide capabilities for new ways of working

### Individual Trinity
The three personal factors that determine individual adoption of change:

- **Incentivized:** Clear rewards and recognition (both tangible and intangible) that motivate embracing change
- **Intrinsically Motivated:** Personal belief in the value of change and understanding the "why" behind transformation
- **Empowered:** Having the authority, resources, time, and tools to actually implement change

### Finding the Sweet Spot

The magic happens when both trinities are balanced. This sweet spot is where organizational elements align with individual factors, creating an environment where change can flourish with minimal resistance.

#### Common Imbalances to Avoid

**When Technology is Neglected:** Great intentions and motivation exist, but teams lack the technical capabilities to execute effectively. Enthusiastic people and well-designed workflows struggle with outdated systems and inadequate digital infrastructure.

**When Processes are Neglected:** Even with motivated people and good technology, poor processes create friction and inefficiency. This leads to confusion, duplicated efforts, and inconsistent outcomes.

**When People are Neglected:** Well-designed systems and processes fail without proper buy-in and engagement. Excellent technical infrastructure sits unused due to low adoption and resistance.

**When Individual Factors are Misaligned:** Employees might be motivated but lack authority to implement changes, or they might have incentives that conflict with desired behaviors.

### Key Benefits of Balance

- Smoother transition periods with less friction
- Higher adoption rates across the organization
- Sustainable change implementation that sticks
- Improved organizational performance and outcomes
