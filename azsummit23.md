# Integration in a serverless world

Thanks for your interest in my take on modern integration. And why lowcode and serverless are part of the equation.

Some books you should love and cherish with regards to integration and organizing value chain across (diverse) teams are as follow.

* [Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions](https://amzn.to/3ElH5d7)
* [Project to Product: How to Survive and Thrive in the Age of Digital Disruption with the Flow Framework](https://amzn.to/3XDvTz7)
* [A Seat at the Table: IT Leadership in the Age of Agility](https://amzn.to/3lLz0I8)

The reason is simple - architecture and team dynamics always matters and your team composition or your development philosohphy doesn't change that.
