# Integration in a serverless world

I am the author of **["IT's not magic, it's architecture"](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B0CVZ1BWPN)** and **["The DALL-E Cookbook For Great AI Art: For Artists. For Enthusiasts."](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B0CVVXKSNF/)**, both available via Amazon.

One deals with Leading, Aligning, and Innovating IT & Business with Principles, Agility, and AI. The other one with the democratiziation of art! (And I mean art in the sense of classic art as well as modern art.)

**Thanks for your interest in my take on modern integration. And why lowcode and serverless are part of the equation.**

Some books you should love and cherish with regards to integration and organizing value chain across (diverse) teams are as follow.

* [Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions](https://amzn.to/3ElH5d7)
* [Project to Product: How to Survive and Thrive in the Age of Digital Disruption with the Flow Framework](https://amzn.to/3XDvTz7)
* [A Seat at the Table: IT Leadership in the Age of Agility](https://amzn.to/3lLz0I8)
* [The Software Architect Elevator: Redefining the Architect's Role in the Digital Enterprise](https://amzn.to/3SjtF75)

The reason is simple - architecture and team dynamics always matters and your team composition or your development philosohphy doesn't change that.

**Here is my presentation** on ["Integration in a serverless world"](/presentations/Integration%20in%20a%20serverless%20world%20combining%20pro%20code%20and%20low%20code%20for%20the%20win.pdf), based on this article:
[Advanced Automation using Azure & serverless services](https://medium.com/serverless-and-lowocode-pioneers/using-logic-apps-to-orchestrate-a-complex-video-processing-process-flow-a0ef20237511)

During the **Azure Summit Event Mid-March 2023** you would have seen the [German version of that presentation](/presentations/Integration%20in%20einer%20serverlosen%20Welt%20M%20Brueckner%2015-03-2023%20MSFT-1005-Azure-Summit-PPT_DE.pdf).

Are you a pro-coder and want to get some backup like low-code devs get with their fancy drag & drop tools? Don't fret, AI could be that booster you need:
